# Data Preprocessing and Model Training Application

This repository contains a Streamlit application for data preprocessing, model training, and report generation. The application allows users to preprocess their data, select prediction types (regression or classification), train various machine learning models, and visualize results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare your data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Get accuracy scores and detailed classification or regression reports.
- **Report Generation**: Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the data and model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots to visualize correlations and distributions in the dataset.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need the following Python packages:

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
